# Perun-Wallet-Wrapper

If your wallet is written or somehow utilizes TypeScript, you can use the
wrapper library here to integrate Perun channels into your wallet.

Mind you, you need a supported perun backend. More details can be found in the
respective [`perun-wallet-spec`](https://github.com/perun-network/perun-wallet-spec) repository.

## Features

* Low-level wrapper around the Perun channel service as described by the spec.
* High-level wrapper with type-conversions to simplify implementation of plain payment channels.
